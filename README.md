# Research Project 1: Characterizing Skin Ageing Mechanisms through Multi-Omics Approaches Using scRNA-seq Data
### Objective:
The objective of this research project is to analyze an existing scRNA-seq dataset to derive novel insights. The project focuses on skin ageing mechanisms using  **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)** 

### Project Tasks:
1. **Data Analysis**:
    - Analyze scRNA-seq data using the **Yascp pipeline** (GitHub repository: [wtsi-hgi/yascp](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp)).

2. **Key Areas of Focus**:
    - **Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)**: Identifying cell type-specific gene expression patterns, protein modifications, and potential biomarkers linked to ageing.

## Project Outline

### Skin Ageing Mechanisms:
Skin ageing involves cellular and molecular changes that affect skin structure, resilience, and function. This project aims to provide a comprehensive, multi-omics perspective by analysing **scRNA-seq** data  to uncover gene regulatory networks and protein modifications linked to ageing in human skin.

### scRNA-seq:
- **Dataset**: A dataset from the study “A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Atlas of Human Skin Aging” has been processed through the **Yascp pipeline**.
- **Donor Samples**: Data includes samples from individuals of various age groups, with **quantification matrices** (h5ad files) available for analysis.
- **Annotations**: Four different **CellTypist annotation models** were run on the dataset. The most relevant model for this analysis is **Adult_Human_Skin**.
    - **Key cell types**: Keratinocyte subtypes, Immune cells, Melanocytes, Pericytes, Endothelial cells, Fibroblasts and Dendritic cells.
